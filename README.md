# Scuffed Wordle

_Its Wordle, but worse, annoying, and I made it in 4 hours._

---

## Overview
I got bored and didn't want to do my discrete homework.

---

## Features

- ✅ Everything Wordle has
- ✅ But you can't use letters that aren't in the actual word again after trying them

---

## I don't know how most of the code works anymore!

It's true, I forgot about 2 and a half hours in

---

## Installation

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/ItsAltus/ScuffedWordle

# Enter the folder
cd ScuffedWordle

# -- Make sure words.txt is there because thats necessary obviously

# Install dependencies (this definitely could've been done without any libraries)
pip install colorama

# Run
.\wordle.py
